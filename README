A Matrix client in CHICKEN Scheme
=================================

Only the most basic features have been implemented:

- password login
- message receiving
- message sending
- emotes

The text user interface is very crude and has a few bugs.

How to use it:
--------------

Run `csi client.scm` in this directory and use the `(init! <server>)`, `(password-login <user> <password>)` and `(startup)` procedures, like so:

    (init! "https://upyum.com:8448")
    (password-login "toto" "my-super-password")
    (startup)


You can quit by typing /exit at the input prompt, your session will be saved in `config.scm` and automatically loaded back next time so that you only have to run the `(startup)` procedure (or directly run `csi client.scm -e '(startup)'`).
